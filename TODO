Modify syslogoutputter to abstract away from exposing the underlying syslog interface.

Merge log4r project changes from github, including NDC and GDC
From the github project README:
  === NDC

  NDCs are per thread, and can be set by:

  Log4r::Logger::NDC.push('something')

  Then in the configuration xml it can be used:

  pattern="%x"

  Which will output the top most diagnostic message on the NDC stack.

  Based on the log4j NDC implementation:
    http://logging.apache.org/log4j/1.2/apidocs/org/apache/log4j/NDC.html

  === GDC

  We also added a Global Diagnostic Context for per application diagnostic messages.

  Log4r::Logger.GDC = "app1"

  Then in the configuration xml it can be used:

  pattern="%g"

  log4_logging.rb uses this to set the message to be the name of the rails application.  
  This can be useful for sorting messages if logs for multiple applications are
  aggregated at a single point, 
  for example in something like Splunk.
